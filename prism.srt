00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,440
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,280
So this will be just a quick demonstration of the capabilities of our latest Prism Accelerator.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,160
So when you first load the application, you'll be greeted by this screen where you will see one of our example templates that's already provided.

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,280
This accelerator is shipped with some sample data.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,040
So we can click into here and we immediately see what documents are as part of our project.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:32,960
So we've got one document here and we can essentially follow this process in order to extract, chunk, embed, and add them to a search index and knowledge agent.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
So we're going to start by the extraction.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,760
You should see a progress bar that will inform you how many pages are done and how many are left.

9
00:00:43,053 --> 00:00:44,853
This process is fully asynchronous.

10
00:00:44,853 --> 00:00:50,933
So for a large document basis, you may leave this screen and come back to it later.

11
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:54,253
It will essentially process the documents in its own time.

12
00:00:56,013 --> 00:00:57,613
It does have smart filtering.

13
00:00:57,613 --> 00:01:04,733
So only for pages that contain images or diagrams, it will enable the vision extraction.

14
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:10,613
Otherwise, it will use the out-of-the-box extraction capabilities that, you know, PDF libraries come equipped with.

15
00:01:11,693 --> 00:01:18,013
So it's essentially trying to save us tokens and save us time by extracting in the most efficient way possible.

16
00:01:18,576 --> 00:01:20,176
Okay, then we will chunk.

17
00:01:21,536 --> 00:01:23,216
We've created 23 chunks.

18
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,176
We will run embedding on those 23 chunks.

19
00:01:26,823 --> 00:01:28,743
We will then create a search index.

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,380
And finally, we'll create a knowledge agent.

21
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,500
And after we've created a knowledge agent, we can ask some questions.

22
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:39,673
And we can see it working just fine.

23
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:44,393
It will give us the answer, as well as it will provide us where exactly the information is coming from.

24
00:01:44,393 --> 00:01:46,073
So there are four chunks that it found.

25
00:01:46,713 --> 00:01:49,833
Another important part is we can now configure the workflows.

26
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:53,873
So some of these questions can be asked sequentially in a structured manner.

27
00:01:54,553 --> 00:01:57,353
So we've got an example of a workflow configuration.

28
00:01:57,353 --> 00:02:01,113
You can add new sections or you can add questions to an existing section.

29
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:03,833
So pretty straightforward.

30
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:08,233
So you basically can shape the question and answer workflow however you want.

31
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:14,473
So let's just go ahead, click into sections, and then basically we can just run an example workflow.

32
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:19,413
These are only two questions, so it shouldn't be a particularly long process for us to wait for.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,960
Okay, one already completed and the second one completed.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:35,760
So we can see in our results pages, in our result page, the answers to our questions as well as the comments that the application is provided.

35
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,480
So that basically is it.

36
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,640
We can also export those results.

37
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,440
We can export and import the templates.

38
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:50,440
So the workflows can be modified either through CSV or directly in the front end.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,080
And of course, all of that I've described can be started as a brand new project.

40
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:05,880
One important last thing to note is that if we are not happy with any of this, we can absolutely clear all output, which will essentially go back to the original state.

41
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,240
It will delete all the chunks, all the embeddings.

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,560
It will also delete the search index and the knowledge agent behind the scenes.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,400
If you find any issues with the application, you can...

44
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,960
click Report Issue, which will take you to our Create New Issue page.

45
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:30,520
If you find that you need more information, you can click on Docs, which will take you to our Readme page, which should help you with any questions you might have.

46
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,960
Hopefully, this was useful.

47
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,760
Thanks for watching.
